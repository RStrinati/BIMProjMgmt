---

## ‚úÖ Actions Completed (October 9, 2025)

1. ‚úÖ **Removed file from tracking**
   - `git rm --cached tools/appsettings.json`
   - Committed in: `0278ace` - "Security: Implement secure configuration management"

2. ‚úÖ **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added comprehensive rules for sensitive files
   - Prevents future accidental commits

3. ‚úÖ **Created secure configuration system**
   - `appsettings.template.json` - Safe placeholder template
   - `config_loader.py` - Environment variable override support
   - `tools/README.md` - Security documentation

4. ‚úÖ **Verified protection**
   - `git check-ignore tools/appsettings.json` ‚úì
   - File properly ignored going forward

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Credential Rotation (DO NOW)

#### 1. Revizto API Tokens - ROTATE IMMEDIATELY

```bash
# The exposed tokens must be invalidated
```

**Steps**:
1. Log into Revizto API console: https://api.sydney.revizto.com
2. Revoke/invalidate the exposed access and refresh tokens
3. Generate new API tokens
4. Update local `tools/appsettings.json` with new tokens
5. Test with `python tools/config_loader.py`

**Exposed tokens (INVALIDATE THESE)**:
- Access Token starts with: `eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGci...`
- Refresh Token starts with: `def50200a37508ab236d9597...`

#### 2. Database Credentials - ASSESS RISK

**Exposed Information**:
- Server: `P-NB-USER-028\\SQLEXPRESS` (appears to be local development machine)
- Database: `ReviztoData`
- Auth: Windows Trusted Connection

**Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ Low risk if server is not exposed to internet
- ‚úÖ Trusted Connection means no password exposed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Server name and database name are known
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If RDP or network access exists, could be exploited

**Action**: 
- Verify `P-NB-USER-028` is not internet-accessible
- Consider renaming database if exposed externally
- Review firewall rules for SQL Server access

### Priority 2: Remove from Git History (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)

The file is still in Git history in previous commits. Anyone with repository access can view it.

#### Option A: If Repository is PRIVATE and Team is Small

**Acceptable**: Leave in history, rotate credentials only.
- Simpler approach
- No disruption to team
- Credentials are invalidated anyway

#### Option B: Complete History Removal (DESTRUCTIVE)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This rewrites Git history and requires team coordination.

```bash
# Backup first!
git clone c:\Users\RicoStrinati\Documents\research\BIMProjMngmt BIMProjMngmt-backup

# Remove from all history
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch tools/appsettings.json" \
  --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

# Force push (DESTRUCTIVE - coordinate with team first!)
git push origin --force --all
git push origin --force --tags

# All team members must re-clone or reset:
# git fetch origin
# git reset --hard origin/master
```

**Before doing this**:
- ‚úÖ Notify all team members
- ‚úÖ Coordinate timing
- ‚úÖ Create backup
- ‚úÖ Document the process

### Priority 3: Repository Access Audit

**Check Repository Visibility**:

```bash
# If using GitHub
gh repo view RStrinati/BIMProjMngmt --json isPrivate

# Or check on GitHub.com
```

**Questions to Answer**:
1. Is the repository public or private?
2. Who has access (users/teams)?
3. Has the repository been forked?
4. Are there any third-party integrations?

**If PUBLIC**: 
- üö® CRITICAL: Assume credentials are compromised
- Rotate ALL credentials immediately
- Consider making repository private
- Review access logs if available

**If PRIVATE**:
- Review who has access
- Consider if anyone has left the team
- Check for any suspicious access patterns

### Priority 4: Security Review

1. **Review other configuration files**:
   ```bash
   # Search for potential credentials in other files
   git grep -i "password\|token\|secret\|api_key\|connection"
   ```

2. **Check environment variables**:
   ```powershell
   # Review what's in environment
   Get-ChildItem Env: | Where-Object {$_.Name -like "*TOKEN*" -or $_.Name -like "*PASSWORD*"}
   ```

3. **Audit committed files**:
   ```bash
   # Check what else might be sensitive
   git ls-files | findstr /i "config secret credential token password"
   ```

2. **Database Security**: Review with IT/Security team
3. **Git History Removal**: Consult with senior developer before proceeding

---

## üîê Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Use Azure Key Vault or similar** for production credentials
2. **Implement pre-commit hooks** to scan for secrets
3. **Regular security audits** of committed files
4. **Team training** on secure coding practices
5. **Consider tools like**:
   - `git-secrets` - Prevents committing secrets
   - `truffleHog` - Scans history for exposed secrets
   - `detect-secrets` - Pre-commit hook for secret detection
