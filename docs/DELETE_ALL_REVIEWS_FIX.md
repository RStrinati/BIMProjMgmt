# Delete All Reviews Error - RESOLVED

## Error Description
When attempting to delete all review cycles using the "Delete All Reviews" button, the system showed an error:
```
Error deleting all review cycles: 'ReviewManagementService' object has no attribute 'delete_all_project_reviews'
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Missing Method Implementation
The UI code in `ReviewManagementTab` calls `self.review_service.delete_all_project_reviews(project_id)` but this method was not implemented in the `ReviewManagementService` class.

**Code calling the missing method:**
```python
delete_result = self.review_service.delete_all_project_reviews(self.current_project_id)
if delete_result['reviews_deleted'] > 0 or delete_result['services_deleted'] > 0:
    messagebox.showinfo("Success", 
        f"Successfully deleted:\n"
        f"• {delete_result['reviews_deleted']} review cycles\n"
        f"• {delete_result['services_deleted']} auto-generated services"
    )
```

### Available Related Methods
The class had individual deletion methods but no bulk delete:
- `delete_service_reviews(service_id)` - Delete reviews for one service
- `delete_project_service(service_id)` - Delete one service
- `clear_all_project_services(project_id)` - Delete all services for project
- **Missing**: `delete_all_project_reviews(project_id)` - Delete all reviews for project

## Solution Implemented

### Created Missing Method
Added `delete_all_project_reviews()` method to `ReviewManagementService` class:

```python
def delete_all_project_reviews(self, project_id: int) -> dict:
    """Delete all review cycles for a project and optionally the associated services"""
    try:
        from constants import schema as S
        
        # Get all services for this project first
        services = self.get_project_services(project_id)
        service_ids = [s['service_id'] for s in services]
        
        reviews_deleted = 0
        services_deleted = 0
        
        if service_ids:
            # Count existing reviews before deletion
            service_ids_str = ','.join(['?'] * len(service_ids))
            self.cursor.execute(f"""
                SELECT COUNT(*) 
                FROM {S.ServiceReviews.TABLE} 
                WHERE {S.ServiceReviews.SERVICE_ID} IN ({service_ids_str})
            """, service_ids)
            reviews_deleted = self.cursor.fetchone()[0]
            
            # Delete all review cycles for these services
            self.cursor.execute(f"""
                DELETE FROM {S.ServiceReviews.TABLE} 
                WHERE {S.ServiceReviews.SERVICE_ID} IN ({service_ids_str})
            """, service_ids)
            
            # Also delete auto-generated services (keep manual services)
            review_services = [s for s in services if s.get('unit_type') == 'review']
            for service in review_services:
                service_id = service['service_id']
                if self.delete_project_service(service_id):
                    services_deleted += 1
            
            self.db.commit()
        
        return {
            'reviews_deleted': reviews_deleted,
            'services_deleted': services_deleted,
            'success': True
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"❌ Error deleting all project reviews: {e}")
        if hasattr(self, 'db'):
            self.db.rollback()
        return {
            'reviews_deleted': 0,
            'services_deleted': 0,
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        }
```

## Method Features

### 🎯 **Smart Deletion Strategy**
1. **Counts before deletion** - Provides accurate feedback to user
2. **Bulk delete reviews** - Efficiently removes all ServiceReviews for project
3. **Selective service deletion** - Only removes auto-generated review services, keeps manual services
4. **Transaction safety** - Uses commit/rollback for data integrity
5. **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed console output for debugging

### 📊 **Return Structure**
```python
{
    'reviews_deleted': int,      # Number of review cycles deleted
    'services_deleted': int,     # Number of services deleted  
    'success': bool,             # Operation success status
    'error': str                 # Error message (if failed)
}
```
