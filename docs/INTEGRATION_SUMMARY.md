  - Direct import functionality with progress tracking
  - Support for both folder and ZIP file imports
- **Import History**: 
  - Shows previous ACC import logs
  - Displays import dates and folder names
  - Auto-refreshes when project is selected

### 2. **🐛 Add ACC Issues Tab**
A dedicated issue management interface as the **second tab**:

**Features Included:**
- **Project Selection**: Synchronized with ACC folder tab
- **Create New ACC Issues**:
  - Issue title, type (Quality, Safety, Design, etc.)
  - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
  - Assignment to users (populated from database)
  - Due date selection with calendar widget
  - Location and trade specification
  - Rich text description
- **Issue Storage**: Uses existing `tblReviztoProjectIssues` table
- **Recent Issues Display**: 
  - TreeView showing recent 20 issues per project
  - Columns: ID, Title, Type, Priority, Assigned To, Status, Due Date
  - Auto-refreshes when project changes

### 3. **📋 Enhanced Tasks Tab**
Phase 1 advanced task management with dependencies

### 4. **🎯 Milestones Tab**
Phase 1 milestone tracking and project timeline management

### 5. **👥 Resources Tab**
Phase 1 resource allocation and capacity planning


## Service Integration

### ACC and Revizto API Proxies
- ACC Node.js service is integrated via `/api/acc/<endpoint>` proxy routes in the Flask backend.
- Revizto .NET service is integrated via `/api/revizto/<endpoint>` proxy routes in the Flask backend.
- All service endpoints require tokens managed by the token broker and set in environment variables.

### New Environment Variables
- `ACC_SERVICE_URL` – ACC Node.js API endpoint
- `REVIZTO_SERVICE_URL` – Revizto .NET API endpoint
- `ACC_SERVICE_TOKEN` – ACC API token
- `REVIZTO_SERVICE_TOKEN` – Revizto API token

### Workflow Changes
- Python backend proxies requests to ACC and Revizto services, ensuring separation of concerns and secure token handling.
- No direct cross-service database access; all integrations use API contracts (OpenAPI specs).
- All logs and errors are returned in structured JSON format.

## Database Integration

### Existing Tables Used:
- `ACCImportFolders` - for storing ACC folder paths per project
- `ACCImportLogs` - for import history tracking
- `tblReviztoProjectIssues` - for storing ACC issues as JSON
- `Projects` - for project selection
- `Users` - for user assignment in issues

### New Tables (Phase 1):
- Will be created when you run `sql/phase1_enhancements.sql`
- Enhanced task management, dependencies, milestones, resources

## Current Status

✅ **Working Components:**
- ACC Folder Management (fully functional)
- Add ACC Issues (fully functional)
- Project selection and data loading
- User interface navigation
- ACC and Revizto API proxy integration

⚠️ **Requires Database Setup:**
- Enhanced Tasks, Milestones, and Resources tabs require Phase 1 database setup
- Run `sql/phase1_enhancements.sql` to enable all features

## Usage Instructions

### To Use Daily Workflow Components:
1. **Run the enhanced UI**: `python phase1_enhanced_ui.py`
2. **Select your project** in any tab
3. **Configure ACC folders** in the ACC Folders tab
4. **Import ACC data** using the import functionality
5. **Create and manage issues** in the Add ACC Issues tab
6. **Access ACC and Revizto APIs** via `/api/acc/*` and `/api/revizto/*` endpoints

### To Enable Full Phase 1 Features:
1. **Execute database setup**: Run `sql/phase1_enhancements.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio
2. **Restart the application**: All 5 tabs will be fully functional
3. **Import your existing data**: Enhanced task management will be available

## Key Benefits

🎯 **Immediate Value:**
- All your daily ACC workflow is preserved and enhanced
- Better interface for issue management
- Integrated project selection across all functions
- Secure, scalable integration with ACC and Revizto APIs

🚀 **Future Ready:**
- Enhanced capabilities ready when database is set up
- Scalable architecture for additional features
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding new capabilities
