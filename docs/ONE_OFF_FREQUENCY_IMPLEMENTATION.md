# One-Off Frequency Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a "one-off" frequency option for review cycles to handle cases where only a single review is needed instead of recurring reviews.

## Changes Made

### 1. UI Updates (`phase1_enhanced_ui.py`)
- **Service Dialog Frequency Dropdown**: Added "one-off" to the frequency options: `['one-off', 'weekly', 'bi-weekly', 'monthly']`
- **Auto-Frequency Logic**: Updated frequency determination to use "one-off" for initiation/setup and handover/completion phases
- **Review Count Calculation**: Added special case handling for one-off frequency to always return "1"

### 2. Backend Logic (`review_management_service.py`)
- **Interval Lookup**: Added `'one-off': 0` to the interval_lookup dictionary
- **Cycle Generation**: Added special handling for one-off reviews:
  ```python
  if freq_key == 'one-off':
      # For one-off reviews, always create exactly one review at the start date
      review_cycles.append({
          'review_date': start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
          'sequence_number': 1,
          'review_week': 1
      })
      return review_cycles
  ```

### 3. Testing (`tests/test_oneoff_frequency.py`)
- Created comprehensive test to validate one-off functionality
- Tests that one-off frequency creates exactly 1 cycle regardless of duration
- Compares with other frequencies to ensure correct behavior

## Key Features
1. **Single Review**: One-off frequency always creates exactly one review cycle
2. **Duration Independent**: Duration doesn't affect the number of cycles for one-off
3. **UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into existing frequency dropdowns
4. **Automatic Selection**: Auto-selected for appropriate phases (initiation, completion)

## Validation Results
✅ Test passed: One-off frequency creates exactly 1 review cycle
✅ UI integration working correctly
✅ Backend logic handling the special case properly
✅ Database operations successful

## Usage
Users can now:
1. Select "one-off" from frequency dropdowns when creating services
2. System automatically suggests one-off for initiation/setup and handover/completion phases
3. One-off services generate exactly one review cycle at the start date

This feature addresses the need for single-occurrence reviews where recurring cycles are not appropriate.
