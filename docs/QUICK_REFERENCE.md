## 🚨 Critical Blockers (15)

**These WILL cause production incidents:**

1. **SQL Injection** (30+ vulnerabilities) - 3 days to fix
2. **No Authentication** - Anyone can access data - 3 days to fix
3. **Connection Pooling** - Created but not used (50+ locations) - 5 days to fix
4. **CORS Wide Open** - All origins allowed - 1 day to fix
5. **Hardcoded Password** - "1234" in config.py - 1 day to fix
6. **No API Validation** - Client can send anything - 2 days to fix

**Total Critical Risk**: Security breaches, data loss, system crashes

## ⚡ Quick Commands

### Security Check
```bash
# SQL injection scan
bandit -r . -f json -o security-report.json

# Dependency vulnerabilities
pip-audit
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# All tests
pytest tests/

# With coverage
pytest --cov=core --cov=backend tests/
```

### Database Pool Test
```bash
# Test connection pooling under load
python tests/performance/test_connection_pool.py
```

### Start Development
```bash
# Backend API
cd backend && python app.py

# Next.js dev (Phase 4 only)
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## 🔢 By the Numbers

### Current Codebase
- **2,900 lines** - database.py (needs refactoring)
- **8,187 lines** - phase1_enhanced_ui.py (needs splitting)
- **4,007 lines** - review_management_service.py (consolidate)
- **717 lines** - backend/app.py (expand API)

### Work Required
- **50+ locations** - Need connection pooling integration
- **30+ patterns** - SQL injection vulnerabilities to fix
- **90+ functions** - In database.py to refactor
- **20+ endpoints** - REST API to build
- **53 issues** - Total optimization opportunities

### Timeline
- **2 weeks** - Critical security fixes
- **3 weeks** - Service layer extraction
- **2 weeks** - Testing & performance
- **4 weeks** - Next.js development
- **11-12 weeks** - Total to production

## 🤔 Decision Needed

### Review Service Consolidation
**Choose before Week 3**:

**Option A** (Recommended): Migrate to new service
- Pros: Clean architecture, uses pooling
- Cons: 3-5 days migration work
- Files: `review_management_service.py` → `services/review_service.py`

**Option B**: Refactor legacy service
- Pros: Keeps comprehensive features
- Cons: 4007 lines to refactor
- Files: Update `review_management_service.py` to use pooling

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

❌ **DON'T** start Next.js before Phase 1-3 complete  
❌ **DON'T** skip security fixes  
❌ **DON'T** use hardcoded credentials  
❌ **DON'T** use f-strings in SQL queries  
❌ **DON'T** put business logic in UI code  
❌ **DON'T** deploy without authentication  

---

## ✅ What TO Do

✅ **DO** fix connection pooling first  
✅ **DO** use parameterized SQL queries  
✅ **DO** implement JWT authentication  
✅ **DO** extract business logic to services  
✅ **DO** add Pydantic validation  
✅ **DO** write tests for new code  
✅ **DO** follow phased approach
