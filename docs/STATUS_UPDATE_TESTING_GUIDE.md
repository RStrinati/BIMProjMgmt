# Status Update Testing Guide

## ✅ Backend Tests - PASSED

All backend functionality has been verified working correctly:

### Test Results
```
✅ Testing with service: BIM Strategy & Setup (ID: 204)
   Type: lump_sum
   Current Status: in_progress
   Current Progress: 50.00%

✅ Setting status to: planned (expected progress: 0%)
   SUCCESS - Status: planned, Progress: 0.0%

✅ Setting status to: in_progress (expected progress: 50%)
   SUCCESS - Status: in_progress, Progress: 50.0%

✅ Setting status to: completed (expected progress: 100%)
   SUCCESS - Status: completed, Progress: 100.0%

✅ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. Unicode Emoji Encoding Error
**Problem**: Windows console doesn't support Unicode emoji characters
```
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u274c' (❌)
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2705' (✅)
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\ud83d\udcdd' (📋)
```

**Solution**: Replaced all emojis with ASCII equivalents:
- "📋 Planned" → "[ ] Planned"
- "🔄 In Progress" → "[~] In Progress"
- "✅ Completed" → "[X] Completed"

**Files Modified**: `phase1_enhanced_ui.py` (6 replacements)

### 2. Database Column Mismatch
**Problem**: `set_non_review_service_status()` was trying to update non-existent `last_updated` column
```sql
-- BEFORE (BROKEN)
UPDATE ProjectServices 
SET status = ?, progress_pct = ?, last_updated = ?
WHERE service_id = ?
```

**Solution**: Removed `last_updated` column reference
```sql
-- AFTER (WORKING)
UPDATE ProjectServices 
SET status = ?, progress_pct = ?
WHERE service_id = ?
```

**Files Modified**: `review_management_service.py` (line 2286)

## 🧪 UI Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Database must be running and accessible
2. Environment variables set correctly (`DB_SERVER`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`)
3. Project with non-review services exists (e.g., Digital Initiation, BIM Strategy & Setup)

### Step-by-Step UI Test

#### 1. Launch Application
```powershell
python run_enhanced_ui.py
```

#### 2. Select Project
- Click "Project Setup" tab
- Select a project from dropdown (e.g., "Project 1")
- Verify billing KPIs display correctly:
  - Total Contract Value
  - Billed to Date
  - Billed Percentage
  - **Billable by Stage** table shows all stages with amounts

#### 3. Navigate to Service Setup
- Click "Review Management" tab
- Click "Service Setup" sub-tab
- You should see a table with all project services

#### 4. Test Status Update

##### Test Case 1: Update Lump Sum Service
1. Select a service with `unit_type` = "lump_sum" (e.g., "BIM Strategy & Setup")
2. Click "Update Status" button
3. Dialog appears with title "Update Status: [Service Name]"
4. Verify current status is displayed
5. Select "[ ] Planned" radio button → Click "Update"
   - ✅ Success message should appear
   - ✅ Progress should update to 0%
   - ✅ Service table should refresh
6. Select "[~] In Progress" radio button → Click "Update"
   - ✅ Success message should appear
   - ✅ Progress should update to 50%
   - ✅ Service table should refresh
7. Select "[X] Completed" radio button → Click "Update"
   - ✅ Success message should appear
   - ✅ Progress should update to 100%
   - ✅ Service table should refresh

##### Test Case 2: Verify Review Services Are Protected
1. Select a service with `unit_type` = "review"
2. Click "Update Status" button
3. ✅ Error message should appear: "Cannot update status for review-type services"
4. ✅ No dialog should open

#### 5. Verify Billing Integration

##### Check Project Setup Tab
1. Navigate back to "Project Setup" tab
2. Verify "Billable by Stage" table updated:
   - Amounts should reflect new progress percentages
   - Total should be recalculated

##### Check Billing Tab
1. Click "Billing" tab
2. Verify "Total Billable by Stage" table:
   - Stage amounts updated based on new progress
   - Total row shows correct sum
3. Verify "Total Billable by Month" table:
   - Monthly amounts reflect updated billing

#### 6. Test Boundary Conditions

##### Test Multiple Services
1. Update multiple non-review services to different statuses
2. Verify each update independently
3. Confirm billing aggregations are correct

##### Test Status Transitions
1. Test all transitions:
   - planned → in_progress → completed
   - completed → in_progress → planned (should work)
   - planned → completed (should work, skip in_progress)

## 📊 Expected Behavior Summary

| Action | Expected Result |
|--------|----------------|
| Select non-review service + "Update Status" | Dialog opens with 3 radio buttons |
| Select "[ ] Planned" + "Update" | Status → planned, Progress → 0% |
| Select "[~] In Progress" + "Update" | Status → in_progress, Progress → 50% |
| Select "[X] Completed" + "Update" | Status → completed, Progress → 100% |
| Select review service + "Update Status" | Error message, no dialog |
| Update any status | Service table refreshes automatically |
| Update any status | Billing KPIs recalculate automatically |
| Cancel dialog | No changes made |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to update status" error
**Check**:
1. Database connection is active
2. Service ID exists in ProjectServices table
3. Service `unit_type` is not 'review'
4. SQL Server is running

**Debug**:
```powershell
python tools\test_status_update_quick.py
```

### Issue: Billing amounts not updating
**Check**:
1. `agreed_fee` is set for the service
2. Billing tab is refreshed after status update
3. Check console for any SQL errors

**Verify**:
```sql
SELECT service_id, service_name, agreed_fee, progress_pct, 
       agreed_fee * (progress_pct/100) as billed_amount
FROM ProjectServices
WHERE project_id = 1 AND unit_type != 'review'
```

### Issue: Service table not showing services
**Check**:
1. Project is selected
2. Services exist in ProjectServices table for that project
3. Database connection is successful

**Verify**:
```powershell
python -c "from database import connect_to_db; from review_management_service import ReviewManagementService; conn = connect_to_db(); s = ReviewManagementService(conn); print(s.get_project_services(1)); conn.close()"
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before marking complete, verify:

- [ ] Backend tests pass (run `tools\test_status_update_quick.py`)
- [ ] UI dialog opens without Unicode errors
- [ ] Status updates work for all three statuses
- [ ] Progress percentages auto-calculate correctly (0%, 50%, 100%)
- [ ] Review-type services are protected from manual updates
- [ ] Service table refreshes after update
- [ ] Project Setup billing KPIs update
- [ ] Billing tab summaries update
- [ ] No console errors during status updates
- [ ] Database contains correct values after updates

## 🎯 Test Coverage

### Automated Tests
- ✅ `tools/test_non_review_status.py` - Comprehensive backend tests
- ✅ `tools/test_status_update_quick.py` - Quick status progression test

### Manual UI Tests
- Status update dialog functionality
- Billing integration verification
- Visual feedback and error messages
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## 📝 Notes

1. **Auto-Progress Mapping**:
   - `planned` = 0%
   - `in_progress` = 50%
   - `completed` = 100%

2. **Service Types**:
   - **Updatable**: lump_sum, audit, license (manual status)
   - **Protected**: review (auto-calculated from review cycles)

3. **Billing Calculation**:
   ```
   billed_amount = agreed_fee × (progress_pct / 100)
   ```

4. **UI Updates**: All related views refresh automatically after status update:
   - Service Setup table
   - Project Setup billing KPIs
   - Billing tab summaries

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Run automated tests to confirm backend functionality
2. Launch UI and test status updates manually
3. Verify billing integration across all tabs
4. Test edge cases and boundary conditions
5. Confirm no errors in console during normal operation
