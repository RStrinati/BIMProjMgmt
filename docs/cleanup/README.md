Current references for keeping the repository organized:

- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` – Executive summary of cleanup needs.
- `CLEANUP_QUICKSTART.md` – 10-minute checklist to start cleanup.
- `CLEANUP_REPORT.md` – Full analysis and action plan.
- `FILE_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md` – Folder and naming rules to prevent regression.

When adding new files, follow the organization guide and archive legacy content in `docs/archive/`.
