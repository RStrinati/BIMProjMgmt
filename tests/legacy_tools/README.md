# Legacy Tool Tests

These scripts were previously stored in `tools/` but function as ad-hoc tests or diagnostics. They are kept for reference and manual execution; they are not part of the automated test suite.

If you need automated coverage, migrate relevant logic into pytest tests under `tests/` and remove the legacy script.
